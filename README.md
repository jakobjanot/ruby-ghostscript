# ruby-ghostscript

ruby-ghostscript is a Ruby wrapper for ghostscript. It is useful if your
deployment requires binary of ghostscript

If you are using Heroku, you don't need this gem because Heroku's already
shipped a binary of `gs` inside `/usr/bin`

## Changes

Beware: The versioning scheme isn't based upon Semantic Versioning!
The first two version numbers are inherited from ghostscript. Only the last
number is used to indicate changes in the Ruby wrapper itself.
